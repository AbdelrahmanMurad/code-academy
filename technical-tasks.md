# GSG Code Academy Application Process: Technical Tasks

In order to be considered for the in person technical interview, **you must complete the following Coding, Typing, and English tasks**. We will consider the completion and quality of ALL of these tasks when we make decisions on who to invite for the in-person interview. 

The coding section is by far the longest section and will require the most time to complete. 

**It will take time to complete these lessons.** We suggest having a consistent schedule over a few weeks to complete these lessons. If you ever get stuck or feel overwhelmed, ask for help on the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/gazaskygeeks/code_academy_applicants#), or drop by one of our campuses in person. We are very happy to help.

## Coding:

Complete the following lessons, which are an introduction to Front End Web Development. **You should make sure you take the time to read and fully understand the concepts, and not just rush through to complete the challenges**.

The lessons have been carefully curated from amazing, open-source teaching resources. We have intentionally organized the orders of the steps in a way to structure your learning. We highly recommend that you follow the steps in the order they are listed.


In the in-person technical interview you will be asked questions to check your knowledge and skills in these topics. **You will be tested on your general understanding of concepts, specific coding questions, and your understanding of your project code.** The best way to prepare for the in-person technical interview is by **completing these lessons thoroughly and honestly (i.e. no copying and pasting from Google!)**
 

**Let's get started!:**

0. [Installing a text editor](pre-requisites/00-installations.md)

10. [Clean Code](pre-requisites/10-clean-code.md)
11. [Javascript Project](pre-requisites/11-project-js.md)
12. After completing the lessons, you should solidify your learning by [reaching 5kyu on CodeWars](www.codewars.com).


We will make decisions on who to invite for the technical interview, based on satisfactory completion of the tasks and projects from steps 0-12. By completing all of the technical tasks, you will have achieved: 
- [x] HTML & CSS Project
- [x] A Javascript "Etch-a-sketch" project
- [x] 200 points on FreeCodeCamp
- [x] Level 5 kyu on CodeWars.

If you get invited to a technical interview, your understanding of the concepts learnt will be tested so it is not in your benefit to copy and paste in order to acheive these goals. **To pass the technical interview you will need a solid understanding of the concepts learnt throughout the lessons.**


## Typing:
Typing is very important skill in life and especially in coding. If you are a good typist you will find learning to code much, much easier.

Join the GSG classroom on TypingClub, using **the same email address you used in you GSG Code Academy application**. If you do not use the same email address we will not know your score.

**[Click here to join the classroom.](https://gsg-code-academy.typingclub.com/signup/GMUR84A)**

By the application deadline, you must **complete at least the first 50 lessons in Typing Club**.

Each lesson should take less than 10 minutes to complete. The best way to improve your typing is to do a small amount, practising every day, rather than doing all of the lessons at once.

## English:

Complete this _Cambridge English Level_ exam. It should take less than half an hour.
