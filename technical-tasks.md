# GSG Code Academy Winter 2023 Application: Technical Tasks

To be considered for the technical test, **you must complete the following coding tasks**. We will consider the completion and quality of ALL of these tasks when we make decisions on whom to invite for the in-person interview.

The learning section is the longest and will require the most time to complete.

### Note for previous applicants: We modified this document, so read it carefully.

## Summary of the tasks:

**It will take time to complete these lessons.** We suggest having a consistent schedule over a few weeks to complete these lessons. If you ever get stuck or feel overwhelmed, ask for help on the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/XBgJHZDJP8), or contact us at codeacademy@gazaskygeeks.com. We are happy to help, and we are highly recommending you to watch **Elzero Web School** [HTML](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAw_t_XWUFbBX-c9MafPk9ji), [CSS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAzjsz06gkzlSrlev53MGIKe) and [JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAx3kiplQR_oeDqLDBUDYwVv) courses.

## Coding Tasks:

Complete the following lessons, which are an introduction to the Front End Web Development. **You should make sure you take the time to read and fully understand the concepts, and not just rush through to complete the challenges**.

The lessons have been carefully curated from amazing, open-source teaching resources - most notably [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

We have intentionally organized the orders of the steps in a way to structure your learning. We highly recommend that you follow the steps in the order they are listed.

In the technical interview, you will be asked questions to check your knowledge and skills in these topics. **You will be tested on your general understanding of concepts, specific coding questions, and your understanding of your project code.** The best way to prepare for the technical interview is by **completing these lessons thoroughly and honestly (i.e. no copying and pasting from Google!)**

- [x] Level 5 kyu on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) in JavaScript.

### Summary:

If you get invited to a technical test and then the interview:
- Your understanding of the concepts learned will be tested so it is not to your benefit to copy and paste to achieve these goals. 
- **To pass the technical test and the interview, you will need a solid understanding of the concepts learned throughout the lessons.**
- If you complete and understand all the tasks listed, you will be in with a very good chance of getting into the Code Academy

Good Luck!
