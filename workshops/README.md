This folder holds workshops developed for the GSG Code Academy.

## Guidelines for adding a workshop:

1. Create a folder with the name of the workshop
2. Create a markdown README file within the folder, copying the contents of the workshop instructions into it.
3. If your workshop involves cloning a repo, just link to your own repo for people to clone (for now, we can maybe create a seperate repo elsewhere at a later date)
4. Add to the list below a link to your workshop.
