# HTML & CSS project

## Introduction

Well done on learning all the basics of HTML & CSS! Now you need to practice! :tada:

When you signed up to do technical tasks for this application you should have received an email telling you which project has been randomly assigned to you - go and find that email to know what project to do next. The subject line in the email will have been GSG Code Academy Technical Tasks & Projects so search your inbox for that. You should also check your spam/junk filter if you cannot find it.

If you have trouble please email the team who will be able to help codeacademy@gazaskygeeks.com

Feel free to get creative with the implementationâ€”as long as you meet all the criteria and have fun with it!

## Criteria 
### General criteria 
Your website must meet the following criteria:

- [ ] All code is written by you.
- [ ] No external libraries (e.g. no Bootstrap, React, or GitHub Pages themes, but external fonts/icons are fine).
- [ ] Your Github repository should be public.
- [ ] Hosted on GitHub Pages
 
### Technical criteria 

1. Writing semantic HTML5 elements
2. Using flexbox layout or CSS grid (or both)


#### Try These Before Starting
These skills will be helpful for you when you start building. Either try them yourself or at least make sure you know how to do it:


1. Two ways to move a div around on the page
2. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
3. Identify the background color of an existing webpage
4. Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
5. Center an element horizontally
6. Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
7. Understand how to use classes and IDs to target CSS at specific elements on the page
8. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn't "go" anywhere)
 
### Preparing for Production
Once you have made your site, follow [these steps](https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo) to create a repo on GitHub.
On GitHub, upload your files by clicking the `upload files` button and selecting the html and css files you have been editing.

### Viewing your project on the web - optional!

If you want to show your work (the project) to others, you will need to publish your site so that others can access it from the web, rather than just on your local machine. The good news is that if you have your project on GitHub (as described above) doing this is incredibly simple.

Github allows you to publish web projects directly from a GitHub repository. Doing this will allow you to access your project from `your-gh-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name`

There are a couple of ways to go about doing this, but the simplest is this:

- make sure that the main html file of your project is called `index.html`. If it is not, you will need to rename it.
- go to your GitHub repo on the web and click the **Settings** button
- scroll down until you find the **GitHub Pages** section
- change the **Source** from _none_ to _master branch_ and click Save.
- it may take a few minutes (the GitHub website says up to 10) but your project should be accessible over the web from `your-gh-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name` (substituting your own details in the link)


### Additional Resources

This section contains helpful links to other content. It isn't required, so consider it supplemental for if you need to dive deeper into something.

If you still feel shaky on your understanding of HTML and CSS, that's okay! You don't need to be an expert by any means yet. These resources should help if you want to shore up your understanding of things:
