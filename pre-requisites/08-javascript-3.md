## Conditionals, Objects & Loops


### Learning Outcomes

Look through these now and then use them to test yourself after doing the assignment:

- What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?
- What are the comparison operators?
- What is nesting?
- What are truthy and falsy values?
- What are the falsy values in Javascript?
- What is the syntax for an if/else if/else conditional?
- What is the syntax for a switch statement?
- What is the syntax for a ternary operator?
- What is the relationship between null and undefined?
- What are conditionals?

### Conditionals

Now it's time for the fun stuff...  So far we haven't done much with our programming that you couldn't do with simple math skills.  Sure, we've told our computer how to do the math, so that makes it quicker, but the essence of programming is teaching the computer how to make decisions in order to do more involved things.  Conditionals are how we do that.

1. Step one in learning about conditionals is making sure you have a good grasp on [comparisons](http://javascript.info/comparison) and [logical operators](http://javascript.info/logical-operators). Follow those links to understand them.
2. [This tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp) is a great first glance at conditionals in JavaScript.
3. [This article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals) reinforces the concept and provides several interesting examples of how you could use it building websites.
4. [This article](http://javascript.info/ifelse) covers the same basic concept \(read through it as a review!\) And more importantly offers the usual 'tasks' at the bottom of the page!
5. [This tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-switch-statement-in-javascript) teaches you about the `switch` statement, which comes in handy when you have multiple conditions.

### Objects101

Objects are a _very_ important part of the JavaScript language, and while for the most part you can accomplish simple and even intermediate tasks without worrying about them, any real project that you're going to attempt is going to feature Objects.  The uses of Objects in JavaScript can get deep relatively quickly, so for the moment we're only going to cover the basics.  There'll be an in-depth dive later.

1. [This JavaScript.info](http://javascript.info/object) article is the best place to get started with Objects.
2. [The MDN tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics) isn't bad either, so check it out if you need another take on the subject.

### Intermediate/Advanced Array Magic

Besides being a quick and handy way to store data, arrays also have a set of functions for manipulating that data in very powerful ways.  Once you begin to master these functions you will start to see ways to use them all over the place! There are really only a handful of these functions... but as you'll soon see the possibilities of what you can do with them are near endless.

1. Start out by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB1ZC7czKRs) from Wes Bos.  If you sign up for his course \(it's free!\) you can download the code and follow along.
2. Watch and code with [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNmRfyNg1lw) of Wes Bos's array series.

### Loops

Computers don't get tired, and they're really _really_ fast!  For that reason they are well suited to solving problems that involve doing calculations multiple times.  In some cases a computer will be able to repeat a task _thousands_ or even _millions_ of times in just a few short seconds where it might take a human many hours. \(obviously speed here depends on the complexity of the calculation and the speed of the computer itself\).  One way to make a computer do a repetitive task is using a **loop**

1. Read this [MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code).  It's a longer one, but make sure you tackle the 'Active Learning' sections at the bottom of the page.  
2. Once again, same info, slightly different context from [JavaScript.info](http://javascript.info/while-for) \(Skim the info if you think you know it all, but **don't forget the tasks at the end of the page**.  You learn best by _doing_\)

### Practice

1. Complete the [Free Code Camp Javascript Basics](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/). You should have completed all of the exercises here now.
