## Memory Match Application :sunrise: :art:

### Introduction

In this project, you'll embark on an exciting journey to create a classic Memory Match Game, also known as Concentration or Pairs. You'll leverage your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to build an engaging and interactive game that challenges players' memory and concentration.

This project will push your web development capabilities, requiring you to apply your knowledge of the Document Object Model (DOM) and JavaScript event handling. You'll manipulate the web page's elements to create an enjoyable and intuitive user experience.

If you get totally stuck drop by the [discord server](https://discord.gg/zSPCPEwn), someone there will be able to point you in the right direction.

### Assignment

Your mission is to craft a Memory Match Game that adheres to the following guidelines:

### Game Rules:

- The game should consist of a grid of face-down cards, with each card hiding a symbol or image.
- Players must flip over two cards at a time, attempting to match pairs with the same symbol.
- If a player successfully matches a pair, the cards remain face-up. Otherwise, they flip back face-down, and the player continues.
- The game continues until all pairs have been successfully matched.

### Technical Requirements:

1. HTML Structure: Create the HTML structure for the game grid, cards, and any additional elements needed for the user interface.
2. CSS Styling: Style the game grid and cards to make them visually appealing. Consider using CSS animations for card flipping and matching effects.
3. JavaScript Logic: Implement the game logic using JavaScript. Key tasks include:
    - Generating a randomized grid of card pairs.
    - Handling card clicks and tracking the state of each card (face-up or face-down).
    - Checking for card matches and updating the game state accordingly.
    - Displaying a win message when all pairs are matched.

4. Interactivity: Ensure that the game is highly interactive. Players should be able to:
    - Click on cards to flip them over.
    - Receive visual feedback when making matches or mismatches.
    - Restart the game when they choose to do so.

5. Scalability: Make the game scalable so that you can easily adjust the grid size (e.g., 4x4, 6x6, 8x8) to increase the challenge.

6. If you have managed to do all that, well done! Now to get them online - follow [these steps](https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo) to create a repo on GitHub.
7. On GitHub, make new empty files and copy and paste your code into them, making sure you save them by clicking the `commit changes` button.
